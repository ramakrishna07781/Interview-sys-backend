Can you tell me what resources you would use to find that information?\" (This assesses problem-solving skills and resourcefulness.)\n\n* **If the previous question involved a technical skill:** \"I understand.  Let's explore a related area.  Can you explain [a simpler, related concept]?\" (This allows the candidate to demonstrate knowledge in a related area and avoids immediate failure.)\n\n* **If the previous question was about a hypothetical situation:**  \"Can you walk me through your thought process on how you would approach this problem, even if you don't know the specific answer?\"  (This probes problem-solving and critical thinking skills.)\n\n* **If the previous question was about a specific experience:** \"That's fine.  Can you tell me about a time you faced a similar challenge and how you handled it?\" (This shifts the focus from knowledge recall to experience and problem-solving.)\n\n\nTo give a more precise next question, please provide the context of the *previous* question.",

Without that information, I can only offer some general follow-up strategies:\n\n**Option 1 (If the question was factual):**\n\n\"That's okay.  Can you tell me what resources you would use to find the answer to that question?\"  This assesses their research skills and resourcefulness.\n\n**Option 2 (If the question was about a specific skill or experience):**\n\n\"I understand.  Can you describe a situation where you faced a similar challenge, even if the specifics were different? What approach did you take?\"  This probes for transferable skills and problem-solving abilities.\n\n**Option 3 (If the question was about a technical skill):**\n\n\"Can you tell me about your general understanding of [relevant topic]? What aspects of [relevant topic] are you most familiar with?\" This allows the candidate to showcase what they *do* know, without directly answering the original question.\n\n**Option 4 (If the question was open-ended and complex):**\n\n\"That's alright. Let's break this down.  What are some of the key components or considerations involved in [rephrase the question, focusing on a specific aspect]?\" This simplifies the question, making it easier for the candidate to answer.\n\n**In short:**  To provide a truly relevant next question, please provide the context of the *previous* question.",
