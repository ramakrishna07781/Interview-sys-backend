"Here are 15 Python questions related to Computer Science Engineering (CSE) topics, ranging in difficulty:\n\n1. **Data Structures:** Write a function to implement a stack using a list, including push, pop, and peek methods.  Handle the case of an empty stack.\n\n2. **Algorithms:**  Implement a binary search algorithm for a sorted list.  What is its time complexity?\n\n3. **Recursion:** Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.  Explain the base case and recursive step.\n\n4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  Create a Python class representing a \"Student\" with attributes like name, ID, and GPA. Include methods to set and get these attributes.\n\n5. **Databases (SQL-like):**  Given a list of dictionaries representing student records (e.g., `[{'name': 'Alice', 'ID': 123, 'GPA': 3.8}, ...]`), write code to find all students with a GPA above 3.5.  (This simulates a simple database query.)\n\n6. **Networking:**  Using the `socket` module, write a simple client-server application that sends a message from the client to the server and receives a response.  (Basic TCP communication).\n\n7. **File Handling:** Write a Python program to read data from a text file, count the number of lines, and print the average length of each line.\n\n8. **Exception Handling:** Write a function that takes a filename as input and tries to open and read the file.  Use `try-except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError`.\n\n9. **Regular Expressions:** Write a regular expression to find all email addresses in a given string.\n\n10. **Data Visualization:** Using `matplotlib`, create a bar chart showing the frequency of different letters in a given string.\n\n11. **Machine Learning (Simple):**  Implement a simple linear regression model using `scikit-learn` to predict house prices based on their size (assuming you have a dataset).\n\n12. **Graph Algorithms (Basic):** Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse a graph represented as an adjacency list.\n\n13. **Concurrency/Multithreading:**  Use the `threading` module to create two threads that concurrently print numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n14. **Web Development (Basic):** Using Flask or another framework, create a simple web application that displays \"Hello, World!\".\n\n15. **Cryptography (Simple):** Use the `hashlib` module to calculate the SHA-256 hash of a given string.\n\n\nThese questions cover a broad range of CSE topics and require different levels of Python programming skills. Remember to install necessary libraries (like `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `Flask`) if you attempt the relevant questions.\n"
